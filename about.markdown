Hi, I'm Branislav Brzak, and I'd like to welcome you to my blog.

I make a living as a computer systems engineer, and I'm truly passionate about the underlying software infrastructure. From embedded systems and low-level software to the fascinating Linux kernel and RISC-V, I'm here to share my enthusiasm with you.
